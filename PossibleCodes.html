/* So my roommate Sergey purchased an Xbox One that came with Gears of War:
Ultimate Edition as a free download. I had a pair of scissors on my desk so
I began to scratch the token card to reveal the token. I quickly noticed I
was scratching too hard because I began scratching off parts of the 25 digit
code! We started trying to decipher what was left but realized it would be
difficult. I decided to write some code to list out all the possible token
combinations based on which parts we knew and what the missing characters
sort of look like. Hopefully this works and one of the generated tokens is
the one for his game, because I promised I would buy a new copy if it
doesn't :'\ 

UPDATE: IT WORKED BABY!!! One of the codes in the second most likely group
was correct, so my program did its job :) */
